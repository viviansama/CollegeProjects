# Voice Recognition by Gender

## **Module:** Advance Business Data Analysis 
## **Year:** 2020

### Description: 
        
> In this assessment I explored a voice dataset which includes several acoustic metrics that characterize the human voice. The main purpose in our case is to analyze the relevant variables by performing a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to draw conclusions about what this data reflects. Additionally, a real-life proof of concept was executed to classify the already labelled data using K-Means and KNN. Our standing hypothesis is that PCA plays an essential role in the pre-processing involved in preparation to train a learning algorithm for classification.
